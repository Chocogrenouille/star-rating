To Do:


I hover on rating --> changes color (a:hover css)
I click on rating --> changes color (a:active css)
I click on submit --> button changes color
After I've clicked: thank you message, image & given rating is shown

Nice touch: if after 5 seconds or so, I go back to the first screen

1. Create basic HTML structure of first view
    - Text
    - stars/ratings
    - button
2. Create basic HTML structure of 2nd view
    - Text
    - ratings
    - image
3. Manage rating in state --> pass it on in 2nd view
4. Style everything
5. Add responsive design
6. Add timeout function
